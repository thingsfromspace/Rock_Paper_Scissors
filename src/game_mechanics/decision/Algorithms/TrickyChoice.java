/**
 * <h1>Follows a more complex decision procedure

 * This decision algorithm works as follows:
 * If the algorithm just lost, it will play
 * the move that beats its opponent's last move,
 * as the opponent is likely to play the same move again.
 * If the algorithm just won, it will predict
 * that the opponent will play the move that beats
 * its current move, and will thus play the move
 * that beats the move that beats its current
 * move.
